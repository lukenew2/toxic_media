# Project Proposal: Finding toxicity
**Luke Newman**

#### Domain
Kaggle has a dataset containing ~2 million comments on civil issues.  The Civil Comments platform shut down in 2017 and made their comments available to the public.  

My goal is to process the comments and analyze them for toxic language.  With an algorithm that can find toxic comments in online forums or chat rooms, companies can place sanctions on users who say hateful statements online and break their terms of agreement.
