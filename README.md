# Toxic Media

## Project Outline

- Goal Definition: To track and detect how likely an online users comment will make another user leave a conversation in an effort to improve civility online.  By creating a web application users will be able to upload their comments and see how "toxic" their comment is before they post it on a social media platform.
- Using the model we can perform an analysis of which social media platform or online forum is the most toxic: Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Linkedin, or Instagram.
- In this project false positives and false negatives will be weighted equally important.  To get an accurate estimate of how toxic each social media platform is, we'll want high recall and precision.  This makes us conclude that our preferred metric will be the F1 Score.
